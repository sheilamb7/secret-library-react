# Secret Library React
Secret Library React is a React application to show the contents of Secret Library API. 
It's created using Vite.

It gets the challenges information and shows it on the homepage. 

When clicking one of the challenges it goes to another page and shows all the prompts for that challenge.

*(In progress)* When clicking a prompt, a prompt/modal appear with the prompt. When you write the title of a book, the prompt data changes (prompts_completed_book) and it shows on that page.
